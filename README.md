# WebApp for Prediction of Car Price (CarDekho Vehicle Dataset)

## Overview 

A simple webapp made using flask for predicting car prices while buying any second hand car. I have used the vehichle dataset from Kaggle which basically belongs to CarDekho. You just have to fill in some basic information like car price at the time of purchase, car engine etc. to get the predicted price. The model is trained using Random Forest algorithm which is named as (random_forest_model.pkl).
