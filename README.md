# WebApp for Prediction of Car Price (CarDekho Vehicle Dataset)

## Overview 

A simple webapp made using flask for predicting car prices while buying any second hand car. I have used the vehichle dataset from Kaggle which basically belongs to CarDekho. You just have to fill in some basic information like car price at the time of purchase, car engine etc. to get the predicted price. The model is trained using Random Forest algorithm which is named as ```random_forest_model.pkl```

## Motivation

What will you do when you get a whole lot of spare time that's too for about 4-5 months? Obviously you will think on utilizing this time by acquiring some new skills or learning something new rather than just binge watching our favourite Netflix's web series. Just like that I decided to work on some project by using my Data Science knowledge to develop something interesting and cool. So I just found this amazing dataset on Kaggle which let me make this amazing and small end-to-end project which can predict car prices.
